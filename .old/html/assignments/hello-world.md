# Hello, World.

In your first assignment you will end up with a web page, no matter how simple, published on the web.

You will create a simple website that will showcase one of your passions. This is not about making the website flashy, but more about focusing on creating a website and learning your new tools.

For this assignment, you will following along with you instructors to complete this homework.

## Objectives

- Get to know your text editor
- Introduce yourself to working on the command line
- Write some HTML
- Publish a web page

## Requirements

- Have `git`, `hub`, `node`, `app-app` installed. We should have done this together in class. Reminder: you only have to install these tools once.

- All of your HTML (and CSS if you do _epic_ mode) should be formatted cleanly and consistently (use your editor to your advantage).

- If you have experience with existing HTML/CSS frameworks (bootstrap, bulma, etc) you may _not_ use them for these assignments.

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Compose a short essay (just a couple paragraphs at most) about a hobby you either enjoy, or would like to learn about. We will be expanding on this page in future assignments, so pick something fun!
- [ ] Put your short essay into an HTML page, using appropriate semantic HTML tags. (See the link `HTML Tag Reference` below). Give your webpage a simple header and footer as well.
- [ ] Deploy your site.

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Use at least 1 image somewhere on the page.
- [ ] Learn about and investigate the `a` to add (at least 2) more pages to your site.
- [ ] Re-deploy your site.
- [ ] [Read more about CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS).

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Research the `id` and `class` HTML attributes.
- [ ] Use valid CSS to style the page (in the neighborhood of a couple dozen CSS declarations).
- [ ] Create a full layout for your page (heading, navigation, sidebar, footer, etc.).
- [ ] Use more complex CSS selectors than we covered in class, e.g. attribute selectors or sibling selectors.
